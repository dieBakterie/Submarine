# Gshn28 Datapacks

## Information

[!CAUTIOUS]
I'm derDelphin and **not** [Gshn28](https://www.youtube.com/@Gshn28/videos), i just extend some of his Datapacks or port them to newer versions of Minecraft. These Datapacks are originally made by him!

As of now i've added the following to the Submarine Datapack of him:

- animtions (forward and backwards)
- colored versions (all 16 vanilla colors)

I'll maintain compatiblity for the versions 1.21.1+, i won't support earlier versions because the breaking changes from version 1.21.1!

In the future i'll port his train Datapack to 1.21.1+ too.
